# Build Web API With Django Rest Framework 
Welcome to this 'Build Web API With Django Rest Framework' project. 
***

## Thanks
Very very special thanks for the tutorial to [Bobby Stearman](https://github.com/bobby-didcoding). His original repo is [link](https://github.com/bobby-didcoding/drf_course).

## Prerequisites
- Python=>3.10

## Considerations
I have added optional docker containers to simplify the build. If you want to use the docker build you should install Docker and Docker Compose on your local machine.

## Getting started
First you will need to clone down the first module.

1) Create a new directory on your local machine. This will be your 'root directory'.

2) Open a terminal and cd into the root directory.

3) You can now clone the first module. You can do this way down below.

```
git clone https://github.com/doganseyfisen/BuildWebAPIDjangoREST.git
```
