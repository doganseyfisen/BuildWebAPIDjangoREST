## Thanks
Very special thanks for providing us this course to [Bobby Stearman](https://github.com/bobby-didcoding). Click to view his original repo [link](https://github.com/bobby-didcoding/drf_course).

## Getting started
First you will need to clone down the first module.

1) Create a new directory on your local machine. This will be your 'root directory'.

2) Open a terminal and cd into the root directory.

3) You can now clone.

```
git clone https://github.com/doganseyfisen/BuildWebAPIDjangoREST.git
```
